#Linear Algebra module
I'm trying to get a better understanding of Python and Linear Algebra so this seems to be a logical first step, since others recommended me to get into github as well.

Therefore i am writing this library.

The idea came after i have watched the 3Blue1Brown series 'Essence of Linear Algebra', which led me to think more about linear algebra and how to use it's tools.
To get an understanding by implementing it seems logical to me.
